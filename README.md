The circuit follows this procedure, controlled by the Finite State Machine:
1. The circuit is triggered by pressing a button on the FPGA (KEY[1]).
2. The 10 LED's start to light up one at a time, in 0.5 second intervals.
3. After the last LED is lit, the circuit waits for a random period of time between 0.25 and 16 seconds. The random number is generated by the Linear Feedback Shift Register module. This time is displayed on the 7-segment displays.
4. After the period has elapsed, all LED's turn off.
